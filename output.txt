Abala, also known as Lady Bose, was an Indian social worker. She was the spouse of the renowned scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose. In the 1880s, she was denied admission to Calcutta Medical College due to the institution's policy of not accepting female
students. Undeterred, she embarked on a journey to Madras (now Chennai) in 1882, supported by a scholarship from the Bengal government, intending to pursue a medical education.   Lady Abala Bose was a staunch advocate for women's suffrage, a stance

welfare have left an indelible mark on Indian history.
